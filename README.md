# Classic Model Reproduce in Tensorflow

## Introduction:

This repo is a tutorial, which is designed for diving into TF painless(hopefully) through some basic and simple examples. It is seperated into two parts, deep learning and machine learning.

In this tutorial, the used TF version is 1.14.0. I will update all of them in TF 2.0 when I finish all of them.
