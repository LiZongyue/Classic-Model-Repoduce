## Introduction

This repo is a tutorial, which is designed for diving into TF painless(hopefully) through some basic and simple examples. It is seperated into two parts, deep learning and machine learning.

In this tutorial, the used TF version is 1.14.0. I will update all of them in TF 2.0 when I finish all of them.

## Install  
1. Tensorflow  


    To install the current release for CPU-only:
   
        $ pip install tensorflow
    
    Use the GPU package for CUDA-enabled GPU cards:

        $ pip install tensorflow-gpu  

2. Jupyter Notebook  


    For a local installation:  

        $ pip install notebook  


3. Another Python libraries:

        $ pip install numpy
        
        $ pip install matplotlib
