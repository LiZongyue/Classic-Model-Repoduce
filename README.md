# Classic-Model-Reproduce in Tensorflow

This repo is a tutorial, which is designed for diving into TF painless(hopefully) though some basic and simple examples. 

In this tutorial, the used TF version is 1.14.0. I will update all of them in TF 2.0 when I finish all of them. Yes, it is still updating.
