# Reproduce some Machine Learning Models

## Introduction:

In this file, all models will be implemented in Tensorflow Framework rather than with Scikit-Learn, because model.fit() is really boring and you can learn nothing from it. 

In Tensorflow, you will have a brief intuition how does the model actually work and thus figure out its mechanism.

But they are still TOYS (Doge/)
